			<p class="description">The <span class="bold">4L TROPHY</span> is a charity race car organized to <span class="bold">bring school supplies to kids in the Maroc’s desert</span>. My school was sponsoring a crew with one HETIC’s student. Our job was to imagine a concept to help the crew during his travel and to increase donations for the charitable organization. My team created a website where people could create a sticker for the car. My job was to realize a motion to explain our plan and the project. </p>
